Five rexx-scripts that flips a range, a track
or a block in Octamed.

When you flip, you do this:

This..becomes...this.
--------------------
C-2   ------->  F-4
---   ------->  ---
F-4   ------->  C-2


In other words: You play your music backwards!


flip_allcmd.omed      - flips range or track, and all cmd-pages.
flip_nocmd.omed       - flips range or track, but not the cmd-information.
flip_onlycmd.omed     - flips range or track, but _only_ the current cmd-information.
flipblock_nocmd.omed  - flips the current block, but not the cmd-information.
flipblock_allcmd.omed - flips the current block, and all cmd-pages.
flipblock_highlights.omed - do only flip the highlights on the current block.

Note: flipblock_nocmd and flipblock_allcmd allso flips the highlights.


All scripts made by Kjetil S. Matheussen 1998.
Based on an arexx-script made by David t. Krupicz. But that one is
nearly totally rewritten.

P.S. You may think this sounds stupid? Try it, and you will
discover new melodies and sounds. BTW: The classic componist,
and the maker of the 12-tone music, Arnold Shoenberg, used
this technik alot in his music. So, why can't you to???
