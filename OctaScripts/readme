---------------------------------------------------------

3 small ARexx scripts for use with OctaMED (tested with
OctaMED Soundstudio but probably works with earlier
versions as well).


"SwapInNrTrack" - Replaces instrument number under cursor
                  with the selected instrument's number
                  (on current track).

"SwapInNrBlock" - Replaces instrument number under cursor
                  with the selected instrument's number
                  (on current block).

"Crossfade" - Cross fades sample ala Protracker. Doesn't
              work with stereo samples because of a bug
              in OctaMED.
