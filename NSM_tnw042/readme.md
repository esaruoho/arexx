Uploader:     kjetilma ifi uio no (Kjetil S  Matheussen)
Type:         mus/misc
Version:      0.42
Replaces:     mus/misc/NSM_tnw041b.lha
Requires:     The NSM-package
Architecture: m68k-amigaos


DESCRIPTION
	This is a small configurable window that displays the track-names, the
	keyboardoctave, the current track, on/off status of the visible
	tracks, volume of the current instrument, midichannel/samplelength of
	the current instrument, and the name of the current instrument.
	I personally have now replaced the maincontrol-window with this
	window in my octamed, and have earned quite some screenspace just on that.

	You specify the track-names with the included plug-in named
	"tnwcontrol". Press a shortcut-key, and a menu will be visible.
	The alternatives should be self-explaining. If you just want
	to set the new name of the track, simply just write the new name,
	and press return.

	The tracknames are saved into the annotation-text,
	so you don't need two seperate files for each song.

	A screen-shot of V0.40 with some of the new features can be
	viewed here: http://www.stud.ifi.uio.no/~kjetilma/nsm/pictures/CRSnap002.gif


INSTALLATION
	Unpack the archive into the plug-ins directory of where you installed
	the NSM-package.
