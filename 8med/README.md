# Arexx
I've found it immensely hard to just find OctaMED AREXX/REXX stuff. This Repository tries to collect them together and functions as a notepad and as a stash.

```
This file will contain all MY own AREXX Octamed v6.0
related work. You can also contribute with scripts of your
own if you like the idea - no binaries, no illegals. ;)

This pack gets updated once a month, look for a site address
below.

All my work keep being copyrighted as long as you use my
ideas and the main part of the code, neither I do not ask
 you to pay, register nor send me a postcard.

Anyway if you feel so, do NOT hesitate to warm your mailer up!
