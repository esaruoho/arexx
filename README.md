# OctaMED AREXX / REXX
This is a stash of rare AREXX / REXX scripts for OctaMED use. Some of them are from aminet, others from long-dead websites, some from "The Zone". Always looking for more, thank you.

Each folder has the original readme.md downloaded from the aminet archives, for instance.

- There's a Sound on Sound article! https://www.soundonsound.com/techniques/octamed-technique-arexx
