This is the idea I got from Ash Atkins:

"
It would be good if the function took a few parameters:
Prefix command (ie 19)
Range (ie 00 to 40 hex or 40 to 80 hex etc.)
Increments per row (ie 2 to produce commands such as:   --- 1900
							--- 1902
							--- 1904

		and 0.5 to produce commands such as:    --- 1900
							--- 0000
							--- 1901 etc.
"

And I hope this function does something like this.

Arguments: (all arguments are optional. If not all argumets are set,
            a small window will appear where you can write in
            the necesarry arguments you have left out, manually.)

-p [n]      - n=prefix (=cmdnum)
-rs [n]     - n=range start
-re [n]     - n=range end
-id [n]     - n=incremet or decrement (incdec). This number allways has to be positive.
POST        - If set, the first cmdlvl will (default=off)
FILLCMDNUM  - If set, all prefixes (cmdnums) will be written. (default=off)


Try it out, and you will see how it works. It's really
useful! When I got the idea, I didn't quite see the point of it.
But when I started programming, I found out that I would come
to use this function _a lot_ when making music in the future!


Example 1:

prefix=c
rangestart=0
rangesend=40
incdec=10
FILLCMDNUM
							--- -0C00
							--- -0C10
							--- -0C20
							--- -0C30
							--- -0C40


Example 2:

prefix=c
rangestart=40
rangesend=0
incdec=10
							--- -0C40
							--- -0030
							--- -0020
							--- -0010
							--- -0000



Example 3:

prefix=17
rangestart=0
rangesend=40
incdec=10
POST
FILLCMDNUM
							--- -1710
							--- -1720
							--- -1730
							--- -1740



Example 4:

prefix=c
rangestart=1
rangesend=3
incdec=0.5
							--- -0C01
							--- -0000
							--- -0002
							--- -0000
							--- -0003
